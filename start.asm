;  8: Double Fault Exception (With Error Code!)
_isr8:
    cli
    push byte 8        ; Note that we DON'T push a value on the stack in this one!
                   ; It pushes one already! Use this type of stub for exceptions
                   ; that pop error codes!

                   ; use the correct stubs to handle error codes and push dummies!

; We call a C function in here. We need to let the assembler know
; that '_fault_handler' exists in another file
extern _fault_handler

; This is our common ISR stub. It saves the processor state, sets
; up for kernel mode segments, calls the C-level fault handler,
; and finally restores the stack frame.
